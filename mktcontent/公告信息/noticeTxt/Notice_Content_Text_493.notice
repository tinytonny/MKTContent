<p><span style="font-family: 微软雅黑, sans-serif;">In order to provide you with more stable service, JD Cloud will upgrade the Native Container Service from October 23, 2018, 21:00:00 to 23:59:59. During this period, the Native Container instances and Secrets console access service in cn-east-2 will be temporarily interrupted, but this temporary interruption will neither influence other regions nor have impact on your inherent business in all regions. The console will be resumed upon completion of upgrade. If you have relevant questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud customer service personnel at any time (Tel: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</span>
