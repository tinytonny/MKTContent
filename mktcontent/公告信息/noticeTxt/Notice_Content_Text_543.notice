<p>Dear user(s), in order to provide you with more stable services, JD Cloud will upgrade the RDS service from 21:00 on December 4, 2018 to 5:00 on December 5, 2018. During this period, the console access and OpenAPI calling in [cn-east-1] and [cn-south-1] will be suspended, but this suspension will not influence other regions. None of the above upgrades will affect your inherent business running in all of your regions. The console and OpenAPI will resume normal use after the upgrades.</p>
<p>If you have any questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud Customer Service at any time (Tel: 400-615-1212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
