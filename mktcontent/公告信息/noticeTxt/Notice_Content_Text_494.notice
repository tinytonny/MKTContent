<p>In order to provide you with more stable Load Balancer service, JD Cloud will migrate the Load Balancer control nodes to JCS from October 17, 2018, 21:00:00 to October 18, 01:59:59. During this period, the Load Balancer console access and OpenAPI service in cn-east-1 and cn-east-2 regions will be temporarily interrupted, but this temporary interception will neither influence other regions nor have impact on your existing businesses in all regions. The console will be resumed upon completion of migration. If you have relevant questions during the migration, please contact JD Cloud customer service personnel at any time (Tel: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
