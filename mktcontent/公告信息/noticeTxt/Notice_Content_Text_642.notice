<p>In order to provide you with more stable service, JD Cloud will upgrade RDS services from 21:00 on March 28, 2019 to 4:00 on March 29, 2019. During this period, the Console access and OpenAPI calling to RDS in all regions will be temporarily suspended. None of the above upgrades will affect your inherent business running in all of your regions. The console and OpenAPI will resume normal use after the upgrades.</p>
<p>If you have any questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud Customer Service at any time (Tel: 400-615-1212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
