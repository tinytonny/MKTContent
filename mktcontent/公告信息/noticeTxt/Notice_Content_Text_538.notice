Dear user(s), in order to provide more stable JCS for Redis Service, JD Cloud will upgrade the JCS for Redis Service from 21:00:00 on November 26, 2018 to 02:00:00 on November 27, 2018. During such period, the JCS for Redis console access and OpenAPI service of [cn-north-1] region will be paused while it will neither affect such service in other regions nor your inherent business in all of your regions. Normal use of the console will be resumed upon completion of the migration. If you have any relevant question during the migration, please contact JD Cloud Customer Service at any time (Tel: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.
