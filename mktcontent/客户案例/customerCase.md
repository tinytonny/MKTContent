JD Cloud provides the required information technology infrastructure, hardware and software resources, and information services. It can bring two major benefits to the relevant government departments: First, the government does not need to invest in the establishment of data centers and large computer rooms, purchase servers and storage devices, etc., thereby greatly saving construction costs; second, the information hardware and software resources are handed over to professional cloud service providers for management, and the government no longer burdens information system maintenance and upgrades, saving operation and maintenance costs. \n<br/>2)\t Improving the efficiency of local e-government deployment \n Suqian Municipal Affairs Cloud Big Data Center is highly flexible. When the government implements new e-government projects, it does not need to purchase additional hardware and software, but apply the existing cloud infrastructure to quickly deploy systems and increase the speed of e-government applications. Developers build and deploy applications on a single platform, greatly improving the efficiency of information system deployment. \n<br/>3)\t Reducing the difficulty of information sharing and business collaboration\n For a long time, E-government of local government has a problem of decentralized resources. Cloud computing can technically reduce the difficulty of information sharing and business collaboration. Through the Suqian Municipal Cloud Platform, government departments can share the corresponding infrastructure to achieve software and hardware sharing between government systems, improve the efficiency of e-government information sharing, and expand the scope of information sharing.",
