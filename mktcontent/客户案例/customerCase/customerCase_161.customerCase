1. Multicloud architecture of proprietary cloud and public cloud. The multicloud architecture provided by JD Cloud supports four major service platforms of Weconex Group and "DeerTrip™" App, which helps Weconex rapidly construct more efficient, stable and secure applications. The core data of Weconex are stored in proprietary cloud, which isolates risks to the largest extent to ensure the security of confidential data. Business applications are deployed in public cloud. Users access network through high speed BGP. With load balancer, large concurrent traffics are distributed to multiple static resource servers and services in Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) are connected through static resource servers. Multiple virtual machines are used in virtual private cloud, of which, JCS for Redis service, configuration management, service management, MySql database and message queue can guarantee normal response in the case of high concurrency. The number of servers can be adjusted at any time by elastic expanded function. On the one hand, it can satisfy requirements of data security, and physical isolation of payment scenarios; on the other hand, it can obtain characteristics of public cloud's auto scaling and use by need.
Payment platform, App background, and customer service system are isolated from each other. Use different virtual private cloud (VPC) connection to guarantee service running while other failed services cannot lead to related impact so as to improve the stability.
Using auto scaling mechanism of public cloud to guarantee the stability and efficiency for uses in the case of high concurrency of traffic, reduce IT cost, offer 24 hours operation and maintenance security protection and guarantee business security in the cloud.
<br/>2. Super HA high availability architecture ensures reliability of business. JD Cloud's original Super HA high availability architecture protects Weconex's business continuous operation with physical distributed disaster tolerance deployment solution of three dimensions of region, availability zone (AZ) and fault domain (FD).
<br/>3. Full Link Pressure Testing Service. By continuous iteration for relatively long time, the full link pressure testing system of JD Cloud helps Weconex address high concurrency so as to guarantee the stability and performance of system.
<br/>4. Exclusive Security Service Support DDoS protection, website security protection, endpoint security protection, big data security analysis, content security, vulnerability analysis management, security monitoring, security consulting and other services provided by JD Cloud help Weconex build the complete security protection system.
